Overview: 
    This Project is a local host website that pulls in data from an xlsx document to display the occupancy of different buildings across Boston University. The Goal for this implementation was to allow for the user to find free study spaces around campus without having to actually be in the building. Each Building will have it's own webpage, and each webpage will display the occupancy of each building overall, and each floor in the building. Moreover, it provides the building name, address, and the purpose of the building. The project Utilizes Flask to connect our front end of Html code and Python and reads in data from the xlsx file using openpyxl. 

Project Run:
    In order to run you  need a number of downloads. First, navigate to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest Python version. Then you need to set up a virtual environment to handle different imports here is a tutorial https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html. Afterwards you will need to run a pip install pygame in order to handle the other installs. Then run pip install flask, pip install openpyxl and pip install requests. Once that is done navigate to the working code in the document using cd and run this code in the terminal:

flask --app main run

Once that is done Click the link provided in the terminal to access the website.
